# ElectricSync

Swift client for ElectricSQL

This Package is still a work in progress

The ShapeSubscription can be used to sync to an ElectricSQL Shape. To use it you have to provide subscribers that implement ShapeSubscriber

## TODO

In current order of importance these are coming next:

- Tidy up and add error handling
- In memory ephemeral subscriber that be used for SwiftUI binding
- SwiftData subscriber
